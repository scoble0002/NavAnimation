         <p>The Night Begins To Shine</p>
        <p>I saw you dance
            From the corner
            I caught your name
            In a conversation
            Playing hard-to-get
            But I can't understand
            When I look at you
            I see the story in your eyes
            When we're dancing
            The night begins to shine
            The night begins to shine
            The night begins to shine
            Night begins to shine
            When we're dancing
            The night begins to shine
            Talk 'til dawn
            My heart was racing
            I took you home
            In the driving rain
            Had my mind made up
            I wanna feel your touch
            When I look at you
            I see the story in your eyes
            When we' re dancing
            The night begins to shine
            The night begins to shine
            The night begins to shine
            Night begins to shine
            When we're dancing
            The night begins to shine
            The night begins to shine (the night begins to shine)
            The night begins to shine
            Had my mind made up
            I wanna feel your touch
            When I look at you
            I see the story in your eyes
            When we're dancing
            The night begins to shine
            Night begins to shine
            The night begins to shine
            Night begins to shine
            The night begins to shine
            Night begins to shine
            The night begins to shine
            Night begins to shine
            When we're dancing
            The night begins to shine
            Night begins to shine
            The night begins to shine
            Night begins to shine
            Night begins to shine
            The night begins to shine
            (The night begins to shine)
